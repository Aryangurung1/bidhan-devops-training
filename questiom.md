Design an Nginx load balancer with weighted distribution among backend servers (Use same application as created in previous assignments)

Serve the frontend(static build) from /

Serve both the backends through any other directory, Run two instances A & B of each backend server & route it through nginx through two specific location or routes. Assign specific weight to each instance of the server within the backend Server A has a weight of 2 Server B has a weight of 1 e.g: Route /api should have two running backends of the same application & another Route /admin should have two running backends of the same application. Each of these should be load balanced. Implement health checks to ensure that only healthy backend servers receive traffic

Simulate a server failure and verify load balance Configure Nginx to handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic (http redirected to https)




Frontend
Understand the codebase
Document how the codebase works
Backend - Postgres and environments setup
Install postgresql without using docker in the VM.
Create databases in postgres for the project. Navigate to .env.example in backend directories.
Setup postgres to use login and a password. Navigate to backend1 and backend2 env.example and setup users and passwords accordingly in the postgresql
Create a clerk application with google login feature. visit clerk.com for it. Setup your publishable key and secret key in backend and frontend and run the frontend and backend applications accordingly.
Run migrations in the backend repositories as required to setup tables.
Application should run and you should be able to create blogs
Add a notfound middleware in both backends
